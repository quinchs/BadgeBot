# BadgeBot

A bot written to easily help you become eligible for the 
[Active Developer Badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge).

### Goal
 The goal with this small project was to create a way to help others get the badge without the need to 
 install/run/visit anything since people are being exploited by scammers promising the badge.
 
 This bot uses a stateless approach when dealing with credentials to minimize potential hacks/leaks of data.
 
 ### Data notice
 
 Your user id and progress is the only thing stored by this bot, using [EdgeDB](https://edgedb.com). Please 
 shoot me a message on Discord if you want your data removed.
